Project Proposal: The Colorado River: A Quantitative Analysis of Human and Natural Effects on River Levels 
Project description/outline
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in population growth and agricultural/ industrial sectors in correlation with the lowering water levels of the Colorado River. The Colorado River and its upper and lower basins provide water for seven different states in the South West region of the United States. We will examine relationships between drought patterns and location, population growth and location. We will be observing these patterns from data collected over the last 30 years. 
 
Research Questions
How has the prolonged drought in the south west region of the US affected the Colorado river water levels?
Present temperature/ drought data from over time
The rate at which its dropping
 How is population growth within counties affecting the water levels in the Colorado river?
Affected counties within 7 states who get water from the river and basin

 Null Hypothesis: Prolonged drought and population growth over time have had no effect on the decrease in water level in the Colorado River

Alternative Hypothesis: Prolonged drought and population growth over time have caused the decrease in water level in the Colorado River
